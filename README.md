<h1>Description</h1>
Welcome to my Code Louisville project! For my front end web development project I took on the task of creating a website for a local business here in Louisville, KY. This site uses multiple elements that I learned during my time with Code Louisville, including Bootstrap, jQuery, custom CSS, JavaScript, and much more. Please feel free to contact me with any feedback - it's always greatly appreciated!

<h1>Custom CSS Classes</h1>
The class(es) I created are:

1. .content-img
Created to add padding to content image

2. .primary-text
Adds color to span and gives bold font weight

3. .primary-content
Gives additional padding to content area where background photo is placed

Several additional Bootstrap CSS classes are included as well

<h1>Custom JavaScript Functions</h1>
The javascript functions I created are:

1. $(document).ready(function() {
  $("#formSubmit").click(function() {
      alert("Thanks! We will contact you shortly.")
  })
});
This function pops up an alert with a message when the submit button is clicked.
